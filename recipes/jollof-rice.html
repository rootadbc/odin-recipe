<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>This traditional Nigerian dish brings out the best possible flavor of rice and chicken. Chicken is first sauteed on the stove top to produce a wonderful aromatic base for the rice.</p>

<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>½ large onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>

    <li>3 cups parboiled rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups water1 (10 ounce) package frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, corn, peas)</li>
    
</li>
<li><p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Place chicken drumsticks in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1/2 onion, ginger, crushed bouillon cubes, garlic, curry powder, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Mix well. Cook until chicken starts sticking to the bottom, about 5 minutes. Pour in water, mix, cover the pot, and bring to a gentle simmer; cook for 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish using a slotted spoon. Strain cooking liquid through a fine-mesh sieve. Reserve 1 1/2 cups liquid. Discard solids.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook beef in hot oil until brown but not cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes.Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the middle and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

</li>
    <li>Heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-low heat and cook 1/2 onion until soft and translucent but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add tomato sauce; cook and stir until slightly thickened and infused into the oil, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir reserved chicken broth, coconut milk, 1 teaspoon herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper into the pot. Bring to a simmer; add rice. Cook, stirring often, until rice is almost tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add frozen vegetables and continue cooking until rice is tender and creamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
