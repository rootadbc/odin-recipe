<p><h3>Description</h3></p>
<p>Dodo (Nigerian Plantains) Recipe. Dodo is a dish I eat often, which means I always have ripe plantains on hand. Its sweet, caramelized flavor and versatility as an appetizer, side dish, or main course can’t be beat. Since its texture changes after refrigeration and reheating (becoming dense, chewy, and even chalky), dodo is best when it’s freshly fried.</p>

<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
<ul>
    <li>2 large ripe yellow plantains with black spots (about 1 1/4 pounds; 510 g), peeled </li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>2 quarts (1.9 L) vegetable oil, for frying</li>
    
</li>
<li><p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Using a sharp knife, cut plantains into the shape and size of your choosing: ½-inch dice, ⅓-inch thick rounds, or ⅓-inch thick slices on the bias.</li>
    <li>Place plantains in a large bowl, sprinkle with salt, and toss to coat; set aside.</li>
    <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200°F (95°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 350°F (175°C). Add half of the plantains and fry, stirring occasionally, until lightly caramelized and golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer plantains to prepared baking sheet, then transfer to oven to keep warm.</li>
    <li>Return oil to 350°F (175°C) and repeat with remaining plantains. Transfer plantains to a bowl and serve.</li>
